# Machine-Learning-ASD-Predictions
This repository focuses on pre-processing and classifying a likely ASD diagnosis in adults through the use of popular machine learning techniques - Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Neural Networks.

The dataset used is the ASD in Adults dataset found from the machine learning UCI database. Gathered by Dr. Fadi Fayez of the Nelson Marlborough Institute, some of the data records are optional, and thus the dataset is incomplete, making it unfit to directly influence medical decisions. It consists of 704 observations with 21 variables; 2 of which are numeric, with the rest being either categorical or binary in nature.

The first jupyter notebook contains all the code implemented throughout the entirety of the project. The supplementary report then provides a formal presentation of all findings, figures, and algorithms, complete with a discussion and executive summary.
